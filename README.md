# GitAlpha - Practice contributing to a repo

Hey guys. This is a quick introduction on how to contribute to a git repo where you cannot commit directly to the repo.

## Steps
### 1 - Fork the repo
Click to fork the repo. 
A fork is an exact copy of the repo, but is owned by you. You can can change the contents of the forked repo and then make a pull request to merge into the original repository.

### 2 - Clone the repo onto local machine
You can do this by copying the link to the repo and running `git clone [link]` in your terminal. Ensure you have git installed on your local machine.

### 3 - Make changes to repo
Edit files in the local repository. After you are done making changes, commit the repo and then push the changes to the forked repo.

### 4 - Make a pull request
On GitHub, you can make a pull request to have it merged into the original repository. A collaborator of the original repository will check the changes and then merge the changes into the repository if the changes are satisfactory. Owners may make comments/suggestions on the code and code style before they are completely satisfied. 

### 5 - Wait for approval and you're done
Congrats, you've made it.
Look at some of our other open source projects to see where you can collaborate.
